#1. Let's be humble. Let's reflect. Let's think. Let's try. Let's be temperate. Let's be thankful.

#2. Don't place high expectations on others. Because other people are clearly different from me.

#3. If you have a clear goal and want to achieve it, throw away everything else. Even if relationships with others are among the things you need to let go of, if you cannot let go, you are not qualified to achieve that goal.

#4. Even if the favors you did your best to do are ignored, show favors to that person at least three times. If that doesn't work, judge calmly.

#5. Never blame others. But it's not all my fault. However, correct yourself and improve yourself through what you learn from it.

#6. Don't let your judgment be swayed by your emotions. Although it may be adjusted to some extent depending on the situation, you must make consistent judgments to be able to move forward without wavering.

#7. There are errors in machines, but there are no lies.
